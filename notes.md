# NixOS For the Haters

## Nix (Package Manager)
- Works in other distributions.
## Home-Manager
- Works in other distributions.
## Flakes
- Could be replicated for Debian and Debian-based as they have apt pinning.
## Declarative Approach
- Not 100% and uses a really limited language.
- In other distributions, you just need a small tool to manage the config files.
- Other Distributions have both Declarative and Imperative which makes it easier to automate, maintaine and learn.
## Rolling Back Feature
- Exists in other immutable distributions.
- Timeshift ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
- Easy to implement in Bash
## Stability/Bleeding-Edge Balance
- True.
## Reproduceability and Shareability
- True.
